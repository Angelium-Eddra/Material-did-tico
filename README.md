# Welcome to Plotick! 
An applicantion where you can visualize, manipulate and understand math functions.

:construction: Source done, UI in development :construction:

## The story about this project
It all started while I was studying about math functions and how they work,
when I realised that an application where you could learn, apply and manipulate
functions in real time could be a really good idea to help others with a new 
tool and at the same time challenging myself to think and to plan from nothing,
wich make me go and search for a lot of diffenrnt areas to make this work.
Yes, Geogebra already exists, but this project was more for to try something
new than any other thing.

# :hammer: Features

- `Multiple functions`: You can draw various types of functions at the same time.
- `Resolution`: If you need you can decrease or increase the resolution to minimize FPS slowdown.
- `Easy implementation`: Due to how it was made, it's simple to your own functions and instatiate them. Read the wiki for more information.
